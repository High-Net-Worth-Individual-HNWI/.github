### Comprehensive Analysis of High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs) with $5M+ in Assets

#### **1. Global Population of Individuals with $5M+ in Liquid Assets**  
Based on the **2024 World Wealth Report** by Capgemini and other sources, the global HNWI population is categorized as follows:  
- **Millionaires Next Door**: ~20.53 million people with $1M–$5M in investable assets .  
- **Mid-Tier Millionaires (VHNWIs)**: ~2.08 million people with $5M–$30M .  
- **Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individuals (UHNWIs)**: ~220,000 people with $30M+ .  

**Combined Total for $5M+**:  
Approximately **2.3 million individuals** globally hold at least $5 million in liquid assets. This aligns with Knight Frank’s 2024 report, which notes 626,600 UHNWIs (over $30M) and additional mid-tier millionaires .  

The discrepancy with the user’s mention of "3 million people with $50M+" may stem from differing thresholds or regional definitions. For example, Credit Suisse defines "ultra-high net worth" as $50M+, estimating ~218,000 individuals in this bracket globally as of 2023 .  

---

#### **2. Regional Distribution of $5M+ Individuals**  
- **North America**: Leads with 7.9 million HNWIs (including all tiers above $1M), of which ~1.5 million are estimated to have $5M+ .  
- **Asia-Pacific**: 7.4 million HNWIs, with ~1.2 million in the $5M+ range .  
- **Europe**: 5.8 million HNWIs, ~600,000 with $5M+ .  

The U.S. alone accounts for **5.5 million HNWIs** (over $1M), with cities like New York (349,500 HNWIs) and the Bay Area (305,700) being major hubs .  

---

#### **3. Data Sources for HNWI Information**  
To access detailed profiles (names, contact information, etc.), consider these **verified platforms**:  
1. **Wealth-X** and **Forbes Insights**: Provide proprietary databases of UHNWIs, including net worth, affiliations, and contact details (for B2B use) .

5. **ZoomInfo** or **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**: B2B tools for accessing professional profiles, though privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) restrict direct personal data sales [citation:N/A].  

**Important Note**: Purchasing personal data (emails, phone numbers) is heavily regulated. Reputable providers typically offer firmographic data (company affiliations, business contact details) rather than personal information.  

---

#### **4. Key Trends and Insights**  
- **Wealth Growth**: The number of UHNWIs ($30M+) grew by 4.2% in 2023, driven by equity markets and tech investments .  
- **Geographic Shifts**: Cities like Austin, Miami, and Dubai are emerging as HNWI hotspots due to tax incentives and lifestyle appeal .  
- **Investment Preferences**: Over 70% of UHNWIs allocate wealth to equities, private equity, and real estate .
